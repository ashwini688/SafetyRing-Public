### 1. 🔒 The Golden Rule: We Do Not Store Your Data

SafetyRing is a **serverless** application. We do not run cloud servers, require accounts, or collect and store your personal data.

-   **No cloud & no accounts.**
-   **No collection** of your personal information, location history, or contacts.
-   All your data (trusted contacts, “Safe Places,” logs) stays **on your device**.
-   SMS alerts travel directly between you and your trusted contacts via your mobile carrier; SafetyRing never sees the content of these messages.

### 2. 📱 Information the App Uses (And Why)

To provide its safety features, SafetyRing requests only the permissions it needs to function.

#### a) Location (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` & `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`)
-   **Emergency Replies:** To include your live coordinates in SMS alerts when triggered by an SOS, a missed call from a trusted contact, or a `#WHERE#` command.
-   **Safe Place Alerts:** The geofencing feature uses background location to automatically send alerts when you enter or leave a designated area.
> **Our Commitment:** We access your location only at the moment a trigger occurs and only send it to the contacts you have personally chosen.

#### b) SMS (`SEND_SMS`, `RECEIVE_SMS`, `READ_SMS`)
-   **SEND_SMS:** To send the alert text messages to your trusted contacts.
-   **RECEIVE_SMS:** To listen for the `#WHERE#` command from your trusted numbers.
-   **READ_SMS (Optional):** This permission is only used for the "Map Viewer" feature, which allows you to view the history of past SafetyRing alerts *you have received*. This process happens entirely on your device.

#### c) Phone Calls (`READ_PHONE_STATE` & Call Screening Role)
-   Used to detect incoming and missed calls from your trusted contacts to trigger an automatic SMS reply. We do not record audio or read your call logs.

#### d) Contacts (`READ_CONTACTS`)
-   Used only to allow you to easily pick your trusted contacts from your address book. Your contacts are never uploaded.

### 3. 🗄️ Data Storage and Security

SafetyRing stores all necessary data in the app’s private, secure storage on your device. This includes:
-   Your list of trusted contacts and their phone numbers.
-   Your "Safe Places" (name, latitude, longitude, radius).
-   A temporary log of recent alerts (kept for approximately 48 hours for your reference).

Uninstalling the app permanently removes all of this data.

### 4. 👶 Children’s Privacy

SafetyRing is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from any children.

### 5. 📝 Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time by posting a new version on this page. We encourage you to review it periodically.
