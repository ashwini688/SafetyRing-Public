1. üîí The Golden Rule: We Do Not Store Your Data

SafetyRing is a serverless application. We do not run cloud servers, require accounts, or collect and store your personal data.

No cloud & no accounts.

No collection of your personal information, location history, or contacts.

All your data (trusted contacts, ‚ÄúSafe Places,‚Äù logs) stays on your device.

SMS alerts travel directly between you and your trusted contacts via your mobile carrier; SafetyRing never sees or stores the content of these messages.

2. üì± Information the App Uses (And Why)

To provide its safety features, SafetyRing requests only the permissions it needs to function.

a) Location (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION, ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION)

Emergency Replies: To include your live coordinates in SMS alerts when triggered by an SOS, a missed call from a trusted contact, or a #WHERE# command.

Safe Place Alerts: The geofencing feature uses background location to automatically send alerts when you enter or leave a designated area.

Our Commitment: Location is accessed only when a trigger occurs and is shared only with contacts you select.

b) SMS (SEND_SMS, RECEIVE_SMS, READ_SMS)

SEND_SMS: To send alert text messages to your trusted contacts.

RECEIVE_SMS: To listen for the #WHERE# command from your trusted numbers.

READ_SMS (Optional): If granted, this permission is used only to display SafetyRing alerts that you yourself have received, inside the app‚Äôs history view. It is never used to read general SMS messages, never uploaded, and can be denied without breaking core SOS features.

c) Phone Permissions (READ_PHONE_STATE & Call Screening Role)

Used only to detect incoming and missed calls from your trusted contacts so SafetyRing can trigger an automatic SOS reply.

We do not access device identifiers (IMEI, IMSI), do not record audio, and do not log or upload call history.

This permission is required solely to enable the SOS trigger on calls from trusted contacts.

d) Contacts (READ_CONTACTS)

Used only to let you easily pick your trusted contacts from your address book.

Contact information is never uploaded or shared.

3. üìç Background Location Disclosure

SafetyRing requires Background Location to deliver Safe Place alerts and SOS responses reliably, even when the app is closed.

Users are clearly informed in-app before enabling this feature.

The permission is optional until you choose to enable Safe Places.

Background location is used strictly for geofence entry/exit triggers and is never uploaded.

4. üóÑÔ∏è Data Storage and Security

All necessary data is stored in the app‚Äôs private, secure storage on your device, including:

Your trusted contacts and their phone numbers.

Your "Safe Places" (name, latitude, longitude, radius).

A temporary log of recent alerts (kept for approximately 48 hours for your reference).

Uninstalling the app permanently removes all of this data.

5. üë∂ Children‚Äôs Privacy

SafetyRing is not directed to children under the age of 13. Because it uses SMS and location features, it is intended for adult users. Parents or guardians should supervise if installed by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

6. üìù Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time by posting a new version on this page. We encourage you to review it periodically.
