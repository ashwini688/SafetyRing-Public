### 1. ✅ Acceptance of Terms

By installing, accessing, or using the SafetyRing mobile application ("the app"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the app. These Terms constitute a legal agreement between you and the developer of SafetyRing ("we," "us," or "our").

### 2. 🚨 Not an Emergency Service

**IMPORTANT:** SafetyRing is **not** a replacement for emergency services (such as police, fire, or medical services). In the event of an emergency, you must contact your local emergency service providers immediately.

> **Delivery of alerts is not guaranteed.** The functionality of the app, including the sending of SMS messages, the timing of alerts, and the accuracy of location data, is dependent on many factors beyond our control. These include your device's hardware, its operating system, your permission settings, and the reliability of your mobile carrier's network.

### 3. 👤 Eligibility & Your Responsibilities

-   You must be of legal age to enter into this agreement and must comply with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction.
-   You are solely responsible for obtaining consent from your designated "trusted contacts" before adding them to the app and before they receive any SMS alerts from your device.
-   You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and for all activities that occur through the app on your device.

### 4. 🔐 App Permissions & Messaging

SafetyRing requires certain device permissions to function, including but not limited to SMS, Location, Contacts, and Phone State. These permissions are used exclusively to provide the app's core safety features. For a detailed explanation of how we handle your data, please review our [**Privacy Policy**](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md).

### 5. 🚫 Prohibited Uses

You agree not to use the app for any unlawful purpose or in any way that could harm, disable, or impair the service. Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to:
-   Harassing, abusing, stalking, or threatening others.
-   Sending spam or any other unsolicited messages.
-   Attempting to reverse-engineer, decompile, or tamper with the app.
-   Using the app in a way that infringes on the privacy, intellectual property, or other rights of any third party.

### 6. 💳 Costs, Carrier & Devices

You are solely responsible for any costs associated with using the app. This includes, but is not limited to, standard messaging (SMS) and data rates charged by your mobile carrier. We are not responsible for any carrier charges you may incur. You are also responsible for ensuring your device is compatible with the app.

### 7. 🧪 No Warranties

The app is provided on an **“as is”** and **“as available”** basis, without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the app will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or that any alerts will be delivered successfully or accurately.

### 8. ⚖️ Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the app.

### 9. ⛔ Termination

You may stop using the app at any time by uninstalling it. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the app at any time, without notice, for any reason, including if you violate these Terms.

### 10. 🔄 Changes to These Terms

We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will post the most current version on this page. By continuing to use the app after the changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
